# ALFAM2-applications
This repo is for any applications of the ALFAM2 package or ALFAM2-data repo that doesn't clearly fit somewhere else.
Initial motivation was for profiling/performance testing (see [this issue](https://github.com/sashahafner/ALFAM2/issues/41)).
It has some other applications now, and is a bit of a messy testing ground.

# Organization
