# ALFAM2-applications
This repo is for any applications of the ALFAM2 package that doesn't clearly fit somewhere else.
Added on Ubuntu
Initial motivation was for profiling/performance testing (see [this issue](https://github.com/sashahafner/ALFAM2/issues/41)).
It has some other applications now, but is a bit of a messy testing ground.
